Objective:
The objective of this Python program is to calculate a student's total marks, average marks, and assign a corresponding grade based on the average marks obtained in five subjects: Maths, English, Hindi, Physics, and Biology.

Explanation of the Code:
Input Section:

The program prompts the user to enter marks for each subject (MATHS_MARKS, ENGLISH_MARKS, HINDI_MARKS, PHYSICS_MARKS, BIOLOGY_MARKS).
Calculation Section:

Calculates the total marks by summing up the marks of all subjects.
Computes the average marks by dividing the total marks by 5 (AVG_MARKS = (MATHS_MARKS + ENGLISH_MARKS + HINDI_MARKS + PHYSICS_MARKS + BIOLOGY_MARKS) / 5).
Conditional Grading:

Uses if, elif, and else statements to determine the grade based on the value of AVG_MARKS.
Grades are assigned as follows:
A+ for AVG_MARKS >= 97
A for 97 > AVG_MARKS >= 90
B for 90 > AVG_MARKS >= 80
C for 80 > AVG_MARKS >= 65
D for 65 > AVG_MARKS >= 35
Student fails (STUDENT FAILED!) if AVG_MARKS < 35.
Output Section:

Prints the total marks out of 500 ("Your total marks is: total_marks / 500").
Prints the grade based on the calculated AVG_MARKS.
